#1
	#Make a lsit of nubmers for the cumputer to guess from, Will use the random integer function to grab from numbers 1 to 10
	# print out a statment that the computer is thinking of a number between 1 and 10
#2 	
	#Ask the user then print to guess a number, print out their choice
#3
	#Create an if elif else scenario for too hi, low or correct
	#If too high or too low make them guess again

#grab the correct modules for the computer to use

#2 getting the input and creating a loop
