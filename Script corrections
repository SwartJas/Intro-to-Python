#Corrections
# removed a space after the equals sign
string1 ="I am a student"
#removed a space after the equals sign, added in  a " " " followed by a space, ended with "
string2 =" in the biology department."
#places string 1 and string2 in brackets, replaced the word and with the + symbol
string3 = (string1)+(string2)
#fixed print statment by placing the subject in brackets
print (string3)
