#Finding the length of the genes

#Workflow 
# 1 Create a random RNA sequence of 1000 bp
# 2 Make a list genes starting from AUG
# 3 Create a list of large genes
# 4 Determine the length of large genes

#1 Random RNA sequence generation
	#Grab the correct modules and load them in
		#Define the Bases
import random
bases = ['A', 'U', 'G', 'C']
rna = random.choices(bases, k=1000)
mrna = ''.join(rna)
print('Your randomly generated 1000bp RNA sequence is:\n',mrna)
print("================================")

print("================================")
#2 Populate your list with genes starting from AUG
	#make use of the split command to seperate your 1000bp at every instnace of AUG
gene = mrna.split('AUG')
print("These are the possible genes if you create a list of sequences that start with AUG but does not include it: \n",gene)
length = len(gene)
print ('Th final total of genes are',length)
print("================================")

print("================================")
#3. Create a list of large genes
	#The append command is useful for adding new elements to a list, a for loop allows for automation of this task
print("Large genes are those that are made up of more than 50 nucleotides")
largegenes=[]
for i in gene:
	if len(i) > 50:
		largegenes.append(i)
print("The following list consists of large genes:\n", largegenes)

# 4. Determine the length of large genes
print ("The length of the large genes are as follows:")
for a in largegenes:
	print(len(a))
