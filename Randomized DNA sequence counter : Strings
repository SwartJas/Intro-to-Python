#Add code to 
#1) Calculate the number of  G’s,  
#2) Calculate the number of A’s,  and 
#3) Calculate (together) the number of A’s and C’s





#given code
import random
bases = ["A", "C", "T", "G"]
sequence = random.choices(bases, k=100)
print(sequence)

#1) count all the G's
g = sequence.count("G")
print ("G's in the sequnce:")
print (g)

#2) count all the A's
a = sequence.count("A")
print ("A's in the sequnce:")
print (a)

#3) count all the A's and C'seek
c = sequence.count("C")
ac = (c) + (a)
print ("AC's in the sequence:")
print(ac)
